 Comparison of performance of different Disk management algorithms such as First  Come  First  Serve (FCFS),  Shortest  Seek  Time  First  (SSTF),  SCAN,  LOOK, Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) and Circular LOOK (C-LOOK) along with the corresponding seek time.  on Pre-Defined Data. Performance metrics for comparison used are seek time, rotational latency, disk bandwidth, transfer time
