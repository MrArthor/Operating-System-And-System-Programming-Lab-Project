# Operating System And System Programing
## Anlysis Of Various Disk Scheduling Algorithms . 

In an OS , disk scheduling is that the process of managing the I/O request to the auxiliary
storage devices like hard disc . The speed of the processor and first memory has
increased during a rapid way than the auxiliary storage . Seek time is that the important
think about an OS to urge the simplest time interval . For the higher performance, speedy
servicing of I/O request for secondary memory is extremely important. The goal of the
disk-scheduling algorithm is to attenuate the reaction time and maximize throughput of
the system
- This work analyzed and compared various basic disk scheduling techniques like First
Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, LOOK, Circular
SCAN (C-SCAN) for the corresponding seek time. From the comparative analysis, the
result show that C-Scan algorithm Therefore, it maximizes the throughput for the storage
devices

### Problem Statement:-
- Comparison of performance of different Disk management algorithms such as First Come First
Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, LOOK, Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) and
Circular LOOK (C-LOOK) along with the corresponding seek time.
on Pre-Defined Data.
Performance metrics for comparison used are seek time, rotational latency, disk bandwidth,
transfer time

### Objective Of The Project: -
- Analytical Comparison between the various disk scheduling algorithms on the basis of
seek time, rotational latency, disk bandwidth, transfer time and predicting best algorithm among
the algorithms mentioned
